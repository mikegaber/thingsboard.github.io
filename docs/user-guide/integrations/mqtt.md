MQTT Integration allows to convert existing protocols and payload formats to ThingsBoard message format and is useful in several deployment scenarios: 

 - stream device and/or asset data from external system, IoT platform or connectivity provider back-end.
 - stream device and/or asset data from your custom application running in the cloud.
 - connect the existing device with custom MQTT based protocol to ThingsBoard.
 
Please review the integration diagram and video tutorial to learn more.
